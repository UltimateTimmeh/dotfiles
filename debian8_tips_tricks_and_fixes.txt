This file contains tips, tricks and fixes for all sorts of problems that were encountered during
configuration of my new laptop, running Debian Jessie 8.2.

==============
VOLUME CONTROL
==============
If there is no sound, or audio is otherwise difficult to control, the package 'pavucontrol' can be
installed. This package allows extensive control over all things audio (both in- and output) and
can most likely be used to fix whatever is preventing sound from coming out of the laptop's speakers.

===========
COMPOSE KEY
===========
To type characters like 'é' and 'ç' using a QWERTY keyboard layout, you need to configure the
'compose' key. This can be done by editing the following line in the file /etc/default/keyboard
(only possible with root permissions, of course):

    XKBOPTIONS="compose:rctrl"

This will set the right Ctrl key as the compose key. Here's a list of all compose key possibilities:

    compose:ralt    Right Alt
    compose:lwin    Left Win
    compose:rwin    Right Win
    compose:menu    Menu
    compose:lctrl   Left Ctrl
    compose:rctrl   Right Ctrl
    compose:caps    Caps Lock
    compose:102     &lt;Less/Greater&gt;
    compose:paus    Pause
    compose:prsc    PrtSc
    compose:sclk    Scroll Lock

You need to reboot for the change to take effect. Once restarted, you can try typing an 'é'. Open a
text editor. While holding the compose key, type the "'" key. Release the compose key and then type
'e'. The result should be 'é'. Try different combinations! Can you figure out how to type 'ç'?

==============
LOW RESOLUTION
==============
It's possible that, after completing the installation process, it appears as though the resolution
of your applications is wrong (e.g. the desktop resolution looks fine but the text in the menus is
bigger than you expected, everything in your browser looks huge, etc...). This might not be a problem
with resolution at all, but with the DPI setting. To fix this, open 'Application Menu --> Settings
--> Appearance'. In the tab 'Fonts', you can change the DPI setting. A good default setting is 96. If
it already is 96, then just change it to whatever (e.g. 97) and change it back. This will trigger
an update to the correct DPI setting, and you should immediately see the size of text in the
'Appearance' menu change to something that looks better. For the changes to take effect in other
applications (such as your browser), you might have to restart the application. A full reboot should
not be necessary.

If the "resolution" of the Debian login screen also looks incorrect, then the previously mentioned
steps won't fix that. Here you need to manually configure the DPI setting in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf
file (using root privileges). In the 'Monitor' section, add the following:

    Section "Monitor"
        ...
	Option         "DPI"   "96 x 96" (<-- add this line)
    EndSection

Of cource you can use whatever you want instead of 96. Now reboot, and your login screen should look
OK.

======
ABAQUS
======
Abaqus is installed by copying it from the feops1 server. Of course this means you need to have a
user account on feops1. As root, do the following:

    # mkdir -pv /usr/local/abaqus/Commands
    # rsync user@feops1:/usr/local/abaqus/VER /usr/local/abaqus -av[n]

In the second command VER is one of 6.10-1, 6.11-1, 6.12-1, 6.13-5, 6.14-1, 6.5-4, 6.6-2, 6.7-3,
6.8-1, 6.9-2, 6.9-EF1. The second command should be repeated for every version you wish to install.
The optional n parameter is to execute a dry run of the rsync operation, to make sure what will be
copied is correct.

Then, to create the abaqus links and choose a default version, do the following (still as root):

    # rsync user@feops1:/usr/local/sbin/abq_links /usr/local/sbin
    # rsync user@feops1:/usr/local/bin/abq_lic /usr/local/bin
    # abq_links

That should be it!

========
RSS FEED
========

I am using tickr to see a see an always-visible banner containing a live stream of my RSS feeds
(think of the sliding banner of text at the bottom of the screen on news channels such as CNN,
etc...) during normal operations on my laptop. To get this effect:

1) Import the tickr-config file from the .dotfiles repository into tickr. Using this config, the
   tickr window will be located at the bottom of the screen and will not always be on top of all
   windows.
2) Because the tickr window is not always on top, it might be hidden by an xfce4-panel that is
   located at the bottom. To make the tickr window visible during normal operations, you should make
   the panel automatically show and hide itself (see the panel's preferences for this setting). This
   is generally a good idea anyway, to maximize the amount of workspace you have for your windows.
   When you need the panel, move your mouse to the bottom of the screen and it will appear (covering
   any window that might occupy the same space of the screen). Move your mouse away from the panel to
   make it hide itself again.
3) Because the tickr window is not always on top, it might be hidden by maximized windows that occupy
   the same region of the screen. To be able to work in maximized windows but still always see the
   tickr feed at the bottom of the screen, you need to limit the region of the screen that can be
   occupied by windows. Go to 'Application Menu --> Settings --> Workspaces'. In the 'Margins' tab,
   set a bottom margin such that maximized windows don't overlap the tickr feed, but also don't leave
   a gap between the maximized window and the tickr window. For the tickr config in this .dotfiles
   repository, a margin of 18 pixels should be what you're looking for.

The xfce desktop environment and tickr are both extremely customizable, and can be configured to get
pretty much any effect you desire by playing with colors, opacities, window locations, dimensions
and workspace margins. Have fun!
