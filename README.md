# To do

- Add cleaner verbosity in installation scripts.
- Turn "Debian tips and tricks" into markdown instead of plain text.
- Add list of custom system keyboard shortcuts (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+F to open file manager).
- Add MITRALguide-pp and new TAVIguide-pp config files.
- Move the `install_symlink_to` function (and others) to a general location.
- Improve backup so files with the same name don't overwrite each other.
- Decouple installation of software and config/others.
- Add more automatic software installations (e.g. pcmanfm).
