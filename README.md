My personal dotfiles repository.

# To do

- Add cleaner verbosity in installation scripts.
- Add yN confirmation for installing packages and repositories.
- Turn "Debian tips and tricks" into markdown instead of plain text.
- Add Makefile with install target.
- Add list of custom system keyboard shortcuts.
- Add MITRALguide-pp and new TAVIguide-pp config files.
- Move the `install_symlink_to` function (and others) to a general location.
- Improve backup so files with the same name don't overwrite each other.
